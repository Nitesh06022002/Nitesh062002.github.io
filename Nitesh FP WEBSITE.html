<p>The Pandavas (Sanskrit: पाण्डव, IAST: pāṇḍava) refers to the five brothers namely, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yudhishthira>Yudhishthira</a> (Or Dharma),<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhima">Bhima</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna>Arjuna</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakula" style="color:>Nakula</a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahadeva">Sahadeva</a>, who are the main characters in the epic Mahabharata.

<p>As Pandu could not conceive children due to a curse, the Pandavas were born using a mantra. They lived in a forest until the death of Pandu and Madri. After their deaths, Kunti adopted Nakula and Sahadeva and took her five children to Hastinapura. There they met their cousins, who were not pleased by their arrival. The Kauravas and Pandavas were taught and trained by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kripa">Kripa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drona">Drona</a>. From childhood, Duryodhana and his wicked uncle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakuni">Shakuni</a>, tried to kill the Pandavas multiple times. One such was the event of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshagriha">Lakshagriha</a>, which led the brothers and their mother to hide. During their hiding, Bhima married <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidimbi">Hidimbā</a> and had a son named <a =href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghatotkacha">Ghatotkach. During this period, Arjuna won the hands of Draupadi but she was married to all the five brothers due to Kunti's misunderstanding.</p>

However, they converted it into the magnificent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indraprastha">city of Indraprastha</a>.
